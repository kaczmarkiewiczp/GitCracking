# GitCracking
Android client for GitHub. This project was part of my capston and was completed in less than four months, fulfilling all the specifications.

### Features:
- Support multiple accounts
- List all remotes (public and private)
- List all issues (open and closed)
- List all pull requests (open and closed)
- Opening new issues
- Editing issues
- Merging pull requests

### Limitations:
- 2FA is not supported

### Development Status:
Unfortunately I don't have time to work on this project. However, I'm hoping that this project will help someone learn Android development, just as it helped me. It can also be used as a good starting point if anyone is interested to create their own GitHub client.
